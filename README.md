## SetUp

**Dependencies**

Run `npm install` in the project folder to install dependencies related to Express (the server).

`cd client and run` and run `npm install` install dependencies related to React (the client).

**Database prep**

Create `.env ` file in project directory and add

```
DB_NAME=pizzerias
DB_PASS=YOUR_PASSWORD
```
(replace YOUR_PASSWORD with your actual password)

Type `mysql -u root -p` to access the MySQL CLI using your password.

In the MySQL CLI, type `create database pizzerias;` and `create database favourites;` to create the two databases in MySQL.

Run the following in the MySQL CLI: ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'YOUR_PASSWORD'; (replace YOUR_PASSWORD with your actual password)

Run `npm run migrate` in your TERMINAL, in the project folder (not your MySQL CLI! Open a new terminal window for this). This will create two tables called 'pizzerias' and 'favourites' in your database.

## Run Your Development Servers

Run `npm start` in project directory to start the Express server on port 5000

`cd client` and run `npm run dev` to start client server in development mode with hot reloading in port 5173.
